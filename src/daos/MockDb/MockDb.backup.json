          "description": "<p>The Raspberry Pi® 4B is the powerful development of the extremely successful credit card-sized computer system. This 3rd-generation Raspberry comes with a high-performance ARM Cortex A72 4x 1.5 GHz quad core processor. With this upgrade, the Raspberry Pi® 4B delivers significantly more performance in certain applications. WiFi and Bluetooth® Low Energy and Gigabit LAN onboard are available for quick and easy networking.<br><br><b>The changes at a glance:</b><br>The Raspberry Pi® 4B has been the latest addition to the Raspberry Pi® family since June 2019. The following improvements/changes have been made to the 4B:<br>1) The CPU has remained the same but has been increased in performance.<br>2) Power is now supplied via USB-C™ instead of micro-USB<br>3) Dual display output via two micro HDMI ports enables 4K video display on two monitors simultaneously<br>4) The 4B now supports Bluetooth® 5.0.<br>5) Upgrade to USB 3.0: Two USB 3.0 ports with 5 GBit/s transfer rate are now available - no bottleneck through USB connection<br>6) now with Gigabit LAN interface (10x faster than Raspberry 3B)<br>7) is now manufactured in 28NM. So far, it was 40NM<br><br><b>Completely backward compatible with your previous projects</b><br>The Raspberry Pi® 4B remains the same in its basic shape and size, so you can easily add your new Raspberry Pi® 4B to your old projects for upgrade. And as always, the entire software was kept backwards compatible. So everything you create on a Raspberry Pi® 4 is compatible with older models.<br><br><b>Your new desktop PC</b><br>The speed and performance of the new Raspberry Pi® 4B has been significantly improved over previous models. Whether you're editing documents, browsing the web with a number of open tabs, juggling spreadsheets, or creating presentations. You will find that the work is smooth and efficient - on a smaller, more energy-efficient and more cost-effective level.<br><br><b>Extended working area - additional second screen can be connected </b><br>Thanks to the two micro-HDMI connections, up to two additional monitors, projectors or TV devices can be operated on your Raspberry Pi® 4B - and this also in 4K!<br><br><b>Quiet &amp; energy efficient</b><br>The fanless, energy-efficient Raspberry Pi® runs silently and consumes significantly less power than other desktop PCs.<br><br><b>Includes Gigabit LAN for high-speed network connections </b><br>Gigabit Ethernet enables data transfer rates of up to 1,000 MBit/s and is thus 10x faster than a Raspberry Pi® 3B.<br><br><b>SuperSpeed USB / USB 3.0</b><br>Speed up your data now and connect USB hub, card reader or other peripheral devices via USB 3.0 with your Raspberry Pi®. Thanks to the two USB 3.0 ports, you can transfer large amounts of data within a few seconds at speeds of up to 5 GB/s. Compared to USB 2.0, this offers ten times the data transfer rate.<br><br><b>2-way USB-C™ power connector</b><br>Sounds somehow familiar? Fiddling around with USB plugs, turning them upside down and downside up until they eventually fit the receptacle. The USB-C™ connection can be used on both sides, so the power cable cannot be inserted the wrong way round.<br><br>This text is machine translated.</p>",
